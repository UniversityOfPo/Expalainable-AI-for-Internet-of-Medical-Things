# Expalainable-AI-for-Internet-of-Medical-Things
Under the esteemed guidance of Professor Dr. Kamrul, this research unveils a groundbreaking Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework meticulously crafted for the Artificial Intelligence of Medical Things (AIoMT). This framework is enriched with state-of-the-art techniques such as Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). A standout feature is the ensemble model, "MedXAI Ensemble," which employs a majority voting method, harnessing the combined intelligence of multiple convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to ensure robust and reliable decision-making. When applied to brain tumor detection, the MedXAI Ensemble showcased its superiority with a remarkable training accuracy of 99% and a validation accuracy of 98%. The implications of this research for the medical industry are profound. Firstly, it offers a more efficient diagnostic tool, reducing the time and potential human errors associated with traditional methods. This efficiency can lead to faster treatment plans, potentially saving lives. Secondly, the transparency and interpretability provided by the XAI framework empower medical professionals with a deeper understanding of AI-driven diagnoses, bridging the gap between complex AI predictions and clinical interpretations. This not only fosters trust in AI solutions but also facilitates informed discussions between doctors and patients, enhancing the overall quality of patient care.
Furthermore, for doctors, this research serves as a beacon of continuous learning. By understanding the AI's decision-making process, they can refine their diagnostic skills, stay updated with technological advancements, and provide evidence-based treatments. Integrating such advanced AI frameworks can also lead to cost savings for healthcare institutions in the long run, as accurate and early diagnoses can prevent expensive treatments at later stages. This pioneering work, which promises to revolutionize the landscape of AI in healthcare, has received generous funding from the National Science Foundation under Award Numbers 2205773 and 2219658.
